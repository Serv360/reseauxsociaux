ing order: Can we map the geography in the international monetary system?; Can we explain it?;
 and Does it matter? This article deals solely with the first question, in
 the context of the late-nineteenth-century international monetary sys-
 tem

  This article started from the premise that any country's adjustment
 mechanism depends heavily on the degree of the international circula-
 tion of its currency. We identified an indicator of international liquidity,
 captured by a dichotomous variable reflecting the existence of direc-
 tional relations between countries' financial markets. Such variables are
 amenable to modem network analysis techniques, and we provided a
 procedure for automatically identifying "core" and "peripheral" nations
 around 1890-1910.
 This procedure yielded a striking result. The monetary order of the
 late nineteenth century is best described as having been made up of at
 least three groups, rather than the two groups generally referred to. Spe-
 cifically, we found, between Peter Lindert's "key currencies" (pound
 sterling, franc, and mark), and the currencies in Alec Ford's "periphery"
 (the Argentine peso being the archetype), a middle class, mostly made
 up of the currencies of European nations, but through which the United
 States dollar passed on its way to the top. Alternatively, if only two
 groups are to be identified, then we are bound to call "core" nations a
 much broader group than is conventionally considered. Most strikingly,
  such countries as Italy, Russia, Spain, or Austria-Hungary were defi-
 nitely not peripheral. Their currencies enjoyed a regional circulation and
 were known to bankers in a number of leading European centers.
 We hope that these findings will provide a firmer basis for future em-
 pirical work seeking to contrast economic performances in alternative
 groups of countries. The classifications reported in Table 5 can motivate
 more rigorously the use of separate regressions for different groups.
 Similarly, the indices of centrality that we constructed can be used as
 controls of the influence of centrality in econometric work. For the con-
 venience of future research, the readers can find in Appendix Table 1
 two brands of monetary geography indices.
 Future research will need to explain the emergence of the structure
 we identified, and to measure carefully how much it did matter. The
 first question is Terra Incognita. On the second issue, research is also
 needed, but there is already evidence that the structure identified did
 matter. For instance, we know that "core" and "intermediate" countries
 were able to circulate debts denominated in their own currency on for-
 eign markets, whereas members of the periphery were not.33 Similarly,
 recent research has reported evidence of a greater contribution of ex-
 change rate movements to external adjustments in countries belonging
 to our "periphery"-unsurprisingly given that they could not borrow so
 easily abroad.34 More work is needed to go beyond these general re-
 marks. But we believe our findings might open new perspectives. These
 perspectives should, at the very least, have the potential to free us from
 the conventional reference, when it comes to explaining the pre-1914
 international monetary order, to those famous "rules of the game" of
 which it is only known that t they never existed.

These theories have three distinct features: they suggest that the emergence
of international currencies is predicated on the existence of transaction costs; they
emphasise the role of strategic externalities and they usually predict strong persistence
in monetary leadership. Our aim is to provide new evidence on the empirical validity of
these insights.

Les techniques vues en cours, c'est de la visualisation et de la description de caractéristiques globales et locales des graphes donc on est pas obligé de faire des régressions linéaires nous-mêmes. On peut illustrer leur résultats par de belles visualisations et utiliser d'autres caractéristiques des graphes pour valider ou remettre en cause leurs résultats ?
